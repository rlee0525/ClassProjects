# Vanilla JavaScript

Vanilla, in the context of coding, not cooking, means using a language or library without additional enhancements. In this case, _Vanilla JavaScript_, would be JavaScript without any additional libraries (jQuery in our case).

## Why not jQuery?

Throughout this course we will continue to use jQuery with Rails.
This is primarily because of the `jquery-rails` gem, which provides us both `jquery` and `jquery_ujs`, both of which are pre-required in `application.js`.
`jquery` gives us the standard [jQuery library][jquery-api] and `jquery_ujs`, which monkey-patches our AJAX requests to include the Rails CSRF token.

Though jQuery comes with Rails, there will come a time in your illustrious coding career that you cannot use jQuery.
There are a few reasons we may want to utilize "vanilla" DOM manipulation:

1. jQuery is a very thorough library, with a lot of nice, syntactic sugar, but that comes with a cost.
jQuery, though not _huuuge_, is a considerably sized resource that will need to be loaded with the rest of our application code.
If speed is our goal, we may want to use the API provided to us by the browser.
2. You just don't need it.
Maybe you are only doing a little bit of simple DOM manipulation in your app and can suffice without jQuery.
3. The company that pays you money doesn't like it. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

So, let's learn a few things about DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.

## But how do I even?

Fortunately for us, MDN provides an excellent source of documentation for all things JavaScript, including the [DOM][mdn-dom].

Now, ye be forewarned that much of working with vanilla JavaScript is looking through the docs.
We can't provide you with a vanilla code snippet for every jQuery method, but we can give you a few starting points.

### DOM Elements

Firstly, we need to understand what kind of objects we will be working with. There are three main classes we will be working with:

* [`Node`][mdn-node] - the basic element representing a "node" on the DOM
* [`Element`][mdn-element] - inherits from `Node`; each element on the Document is a decendent of `Element`
* [`HTMLElement`][mdn-htmlelement] - inherits from `Element`, but more specifically represent HTML elements (those created from an HTML tag)
  * [`HTMLCollection`][mdn-htmlcollection] - an array-like object containing a collection of `HTMLElement`
* [`Document`][mdn-document] - the root element of our page, serves as an entry point to the content in our page (HTML elements, JS, browser events, etc.)

### Doing stuff

So, if we want to select something from the page, we would start by calling a method on `document`, (an instance of `Document` and `Element`) and return either an `HTMLElement` or `HTMLCollection` depending upon whether we searched broadly (class name, tag name) or specifically (id).
From the returned items, we can do more sub-selection, assign event handlers, or mutate elements.

A few methods to get you started:
* [`document.getElementById`][getElementById]
* [`Element.getElementsByClassName`][getElementsByClassName]
* [`Element.querySelectorAll`][querySelectorAll]
* [`EventTarget.addEventListener`][addEventListener]
* [`Node.appendChild`][appendChild]
* [`Node.removeChild`][removeChild]

Remember to look through the docs to determine what your return value will be and find even more specific/helpful methods.

**NB:** Although we will mostly be working with `HTMLElement` objects, many of the methods we need for selection and mutation may be defined on the ancestor classes, `Element` or `Node`.

## Why do we (and Rails) like `$.ajax` so much?

The reasons we like jQuery for AJAX requests are:

1. The version of jQuery that is included in Rails will automatically handle CSRF tokens for us.
2. jQuery will automatically transform JSON (which is a string) into JavaScript objects.
If we use XHR (the vanilla-DOM way), we have to handle this ourselves.
3. jQuery's API is much more user-friendly than XHR.

Although we will be relying on jQuery, you may be asked about non-jQuery AJAX requests in interviews or if you end up working with a stack that doesn't rely on jQuery. Therefore it is important to know how to use vanilla DOM.

Check out [`AJAXTwitter's UserSearch class with Vanilla JavaScript`][vanilla-user-search] to see how these and other methods might be used.

## XMLHttpRequest

The functionality of AJAX is accomplished though something called an XMLHttpRequest object (aka **XHR**). The steps to make an XHR request are:

1. Create a XHR object.
2. Tell it where to go and what verb to use ('Get', 'Post', etc).
3. Tell it what to do when it's finished loading (register a callback).
4. Send off the request (with optional data).

Let's see an example:

```js
//step 1 - create xhr object
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// step 2 - specify path and verb
xhr.open('POST', 'api/path/to/resource');

// step 3 - register a callback
xhr.onload = function () {
  console.log(xhr.status) // for status info
  console.log(xhr.responseType) //the type of data that was returned
  console.log(xhr.response) //the actual response. For json api calls, this will be a json string
}

// step 4 - send off the request with optional data
const optionalData = { name: "User1", password : "123456" };
xhr.send(optionalData);
```
