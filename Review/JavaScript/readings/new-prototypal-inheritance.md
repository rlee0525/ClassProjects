# ES6 Prototypal Inheritance

Previously, we've had to create an empty `Surrogate` function to properly set
up an prototype chain.

```js
function Surrogate() {};
Surrogate.prototype = parent.prototype;
child.prototype = new Surrogate();
child.prototype.constructor = child;
```

This was a way to set up an inheritance chain without directly changing the
`__proto__` property.

With ES6, `__proto__` has become standardized and can be used as an accessor
for the prototype of the object it's called on. This means that we can set up
inheritance simply by writing:

```js
child.prototype.__proto__ = parent.prototype;
child.prototype.constructor = child;
```

## `Object.setPrototypeOf`

Changing the `__proto__` directly is something that's highly discouraged, so we
can use `Object.getPrototypeOf` and `Object.setPrototypeOf` as our getter and
setter instead.

For example:

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf(parent) //returns parent.prototype
```

Remember that when we write inheritance, we don't want to just set the child's
prototype to the parent's prototype. If we do this, any functions we write in
the child class will also be available to the parent. We want to set the
child's prototype's `__proto__` equal to the parent's prototype to properly
establish the chain of inheritance. `Object.setPrototypeOf` takes two
arguments: the object whose prototype we want to link, and the prototype we
want to link it to.

```js
Object.setPrototypeOf(child.prototype, parent.prototype);
child.prototype.constructor = child;
```

If we simply passed in `child`, we would run into the problem of setting the
child's prototype to the parent's prototype.

## `Object.create`

Because of how JavaScript searches for and accesses properties in the prototype
chain, anything that changes the prototype of an object will lead to very poor
performance.

We can use `Object.create` to get around this problem.

```js
child.prototype = Object.create(parent.prototype);
child.prototype.constructor = child;
```

This is currently the recommended way to establish prototypal inheritance in
JavaScript.
