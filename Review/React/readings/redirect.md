# `<Redirect>`

The `<Redirect>` component from React Router takes only one prop: `to`.
When it renders, it replaces the current URL with the the value of its `to` prop.
Typically we conditionally render `<Redirect>` to redirect the user away from
some page we don't want them to visit. For example, we might want to redirect
the user to a login page if they aren't currently logged in.

```js
<Route exact path="/" render={() => (
  this.props.currentUser ? (
    <Home/>
  ) : (
    <Redirect to="/login" />
  )
)}/>
```

Note: we will teach you to use a more flexible auth pattern - don't
directly imitate this example.
