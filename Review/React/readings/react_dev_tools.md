# React Developer Tools

## Debugging React is Hard
React is a great front-end framework, but can be tough to debug or see the big picture. Nested components defined in other disparate folders and JSX syntax make it hard to get a clear snapshot of your component hierarchy and each component's internal state.

## React Developer Tools are Wicked Easy
React Developer Tools are easy to install and require no set-up. Just install the [React Developer Tools Chrome Extension][chrome_extension] and open up the Chrome Console. You should see a new tab, 'React', that will show you all your components, and give you access to their state.

Check out the [docs][docs] for a brief overview. You can even use React Developer Tools on the [React homepage][react_home]. So meta. A couple things to try:
* Inspect a component, looking at it's props and state
* Change a component's state from the console
* Compare a component to the native HTML it generates (look at the "Elements" tab)

Take a few minutes to install the extension and play around with it while completing tonights homework. If nothing else, it will expand your visual model of React and your component hierarchy.
