## Using The Specs

Some specs have been written to guide you towards the lite. There are
rspec specs in the `spec` directory and demo servers for you to try
in the `bin` directory.

## Suggested Order

0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/p02_controller_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/p03_template_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/p04_session_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/p05_router_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/p06_integration_spec.rb`

Run `bundle exec rspec` to run all the spec files.
